print('Once upon a time, there was a singular crow sitting on the branch of a tree.')
print('The crow was scouting for food to snatch from the unsuspecting human in the town below the swaing branches.')
print('A young girl sitting at an outdoor restraunt table had dropped a french fry. This was the time to strike for this crow.')
print('The crow swooped downwards from his branch and snatched the fry before the girl noticed what had happened. The crow gobbled up the fry and return to his perch ready to steal any other morsels that escaped clumbsy hands.')
